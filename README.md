# LLMV Translation Project

## Overview
The LLMV Translation Project is an innovative application designed to translate scanned pages using advanced AI technology. This project leverages the capabilities of GPT-4 for accurate and efficient translations.

## Features
As of the current version, the following features have been implemented:

- **Image Translation**: Users can translate text within images, where the translation is provided by GPT-4.
- **Basic User Interface**: A simple user interface using Panel library for displaying images and translated text.
- **Image and Text Display**: A panel that shows the image on one side and an output text in an editor on the other side.

## Upcoming Features
- **File Upload Capability**: In future updates, we plan to integrate a feature that allows users to upload image files directly through the user interface.

## Installation and Setup

2. Install Poetry, a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python.
